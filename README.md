# Dog Breed Identification 

A project which takes in an image of a dog and classifies it into a breed with 99.8% Accuracy


## Features

- Image Recognition: The project utilizes advanced image recognition techniques to accurately identify the breed of a dog based on an input image. It leverages deep learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze various features of the dog's appearance.

- High Accuracy: The project boasts an impressive accuracy rate of 99.8% in correctly identifying dog breeds. This high accuracy is achieved through extensive training of the model on a large dataset of labeled dog images, allowing it to recognize even subtle differences between different breeds.

- Comprehensive Breed Database: The project incorporates a vast and comprehensive database of various dog breeds. It covers a wide range of recognized breeds, including popular ones as well as lesser-known or rare breeds, ensuring accurate identification for a diverse set of dog images.

- Real-time Processing: The project is designed to deliver fast and efficient results, enabling real-time processing of dog images. Users can receive the breed classification within seconds of uploading the image, making it convenient and time-saving.


## Technology Stack

 - Base Model: MobileNet v2: MobileNet v2 is a popular deep learning architecture specifically designed for efficient mobile and embedded vision applications. It provides a good balance between accuracy and model size, making it suitable for mobile devices or resource-constrained environments.

 - TensorFlow Hub: TensorFlow Hub is a repository of pre-trained models that can be easily integrated into TensorFlow projects. It provides a convenient way to access and incorporate pre-trained models, including MobileNet v2, into the dog breed identification project.

 - TensorFlow 2.0 API: TensorFlow 2.0 is a major update of the TensorFlow library that introduces several improvements and simplifications. It provides a high-level API that makes it easier to build, train, and deploy machine learning models, including deep learning models.

 - Python: Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language that offers extensive libraries and frameworks for machine learning and deep learning tasks. It provides a clean and readable syntax, making it suitable for both prototyping and production-level development.
